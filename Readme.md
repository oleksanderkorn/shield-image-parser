***Java Developer Task***

*General*

The goal is to import images from a remote server using an API and show the response on a
web page.

*IMPORTANT!*

The emphasis of this task is about object oriented design. Obviously, you should present a
working software but a working software with no/bad design will not be enough.
Make sure you write a clean and readable code with proper names to variables and fields.

*Please develop the following software:*

1. Build a Spring MVC website with one page.
2. When the page loads it will call another page in Ajax to retrieve information about
photos.
    - On the server side of Ajax calls, perform a call to another server to retrieve a
JSON document with photos information from the following URL:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/shielddevtest/photo.txt
    - Return the response to the client.
3. On the client side, parse the ajax response and present the photos and information
